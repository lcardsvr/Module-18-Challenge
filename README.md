# Module 18 Challenge

The data for the first quarter of 2023 was used.

For the period in question around 80% of the rides were done using a classic bike and almost 20% using Electic bike. 

The percentage of members ranged from 86 to 88% for the 3 months. The remaining number were casual users.

March had the biggest number of started trips with 2,194,214 started trips followed by January with 1,855,201 and February with 1,752,148.

The great majority of the rides lasted less than 30 minutes. the second cohort of rides where between 30 to 60 min.

The great majorority of trips were under 5 km. The distance was calculated for each point using a the distance of straight line formed by the coordinates of the initial and ending points. 

The longest average distance to an ending station was 10.14 km, followed by 8.95 km and 8.49 km.

There are 2 peak hours for starting and ending time for the horizon. The biggest one in the afternoon is at 5pm and the morning one at 8 am.

The station that has the most number of starting trips was W 21 St & 6 Ave followed by University Pl & E14 st and 1 Ave & E 68st. This was the case for the 3 months under study. There is a metro station close to the station with the most trips. The station with the most ending trips are the same 3 station listed above.

## Data handling

The data was joined per quarter using python. The distance between the 2 points was also calculated in Python to minimize the calculations done in Tableau.

## Requirements

### Maps

2 Mapas are displayed with the bike stations. The month can be used to change the top 10 stations and colors change with the user input.

### Visualisations

2 Dashboards and a story were created.

## Analysis

The analysis is listed above
